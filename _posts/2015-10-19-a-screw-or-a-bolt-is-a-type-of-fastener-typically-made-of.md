# A screw, or a bolt, is a type of fastener, typically made of metal, and characterized by a helical ridge, known as a _male thread _(external thread) or just _thread_, wrapped around a cylinder. Some screw threads are designed to mate with a complementary thread, known as a _female thread _(internal thread), often in the form of a nut or an object that has the internal thread formed into it. Other screw threads are designed to cut a helical groove in a softer material as the screw is inserted. The most common uses of screws are to hold objects together and to position objects.
